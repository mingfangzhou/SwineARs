# SwineARs Project
The main code of Swine AR project includes the following three parts: 
1.Multi-genome alignment was performed to identify conserved regions across species and to identify accelerated evolutionary regions of different lineages of swine. 
2.To clarify the genetic characteristics of swine ARs in different pig lineages, in this study we analyzed three key genetic measurement indicators: genetic diversity, spatial distribution patterns, and spatial relationship with structural variations.
3.The RNA data of GTEx project were used to analyze the expression between different tissues and across species.
